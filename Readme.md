Mass Spectrometer
MRM-Profiling for Lipidomics and Metabolomics
Small molecules, including metabolites and lipids, play significant roles in disease and especially in cancer. Diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of certain diseases have been designed or improved with increasing knowledge from pathway analysis. However, discovery and characterization of small molecule metabolic functions has been a challenging task for years. Current exploratory methodologies for metabolomics and lipidomics are based on liquid or gas chromatography(LC or GC) coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry(HRMS) to generate a large set of data involving lengthy data acquisition, typically 30-60 min per sample. Even though many molecules can be distinguished by these methods, the highly laborious protocols for purification, identification, and validation results in loss or dilution of sample chemical information and high costs.

Figure below: Four basic operations of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer: product ion scan (Prod), precursor ion scan (Prec), neutral loss scan(NL), and multiple reaction monitoring(MRM). Operation on each quadrupole mass filter is either “Fix” or “Scan”, except that q2 is always where fragmentation happens.
